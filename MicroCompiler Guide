This guide serves to document the basic structure of the compiler and the format of its input/output files.


## .mias file format

###The .mias file

A file ending in the .mias extension will be interpretted as a **MI**crocompiler **AS**sembly file. This file will serve as the editable input to the microcompiler to be coverted into a binary file to be uploaded to a xilinx ARTYZ7 FPGA implementing the microcontroller. The compiled binary (.mbin) programs the instruction BRAM (used as ROM) and other future ROMs / Programmable memory
